<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Recent rapid advances in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) highlight the philosophical shift in both technology development and policy making of radio spectrum management. The driving force behind this shift is the commonly accepted belief that the radio spectrum, as a scarce public resource, can be utilized more efficiently and fairly by the partnership of smarter management and looser regulations. This in turn will lead to democratization of the radio spectrum to people of wider socioeconomic strata, as well as to a much larger variety of present and future communication needs and services. This work seeks to assist in the democratization of such spectrum through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>developing techniques for spectrum mapping to protect against internal and external attacks, and evaluating the tradeoffs between privacy protection and accuracy of the spectrum map,</p></li>
<li><p>implementing the privacy-preserving spectrum mapping techniques using software-defined radios and Andriod phones,</p></li>
<li><p>implementing our privacy-preserving spectrum mapping techniques using a Computing Agent/Spectrum Application Server/Spectrum Usage Database framework, run on a commercially available cloud-computing service, and</p></li>
<li><p>conducting an outreach class on radio and dynamic spectrum access at the Cade Museum for Science+Innovation</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>We are developing novel techniques to protect the privacy of users
involved in sensing the radio spectrum as part of a DSA system. The
techniques we propose are built on top of secure computing primitives,
such as anonymyizing proxies, public-key encryption, and garbled
circuits, which uses cryptographic techniques to allow users to
compute a result without any of the parties being able to know the
other parties' inputs to the computation. Although complete privacy is
not possible in a spectrum sensing system, we are developing systems
    that achieve <i>k</i>-anonymity in the presence of adversaries with various
    capabilities. In <i>k</i>-anonymity, a user's location and
    capabilities may only be reduced to one of <i>k</i> possibilities. A
significant challenge in developing such techniques is that many
secure computing primitives require high computational complexity, and
thus cannot be implemented on many DSA devices, such as future
generations of cellular phones. Thus, we are developing
privacy-preserving spectrum sensing techniques that have sufficiently
low complexity to be implemented on such devices. 
  </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Year 1:</b> In year 1, our activities primarily focused on the
development of a distributed, privacy-preserving algorithm to perform
localization on a RF source in the presence of a semi-honest
(honest-but-curious) adversary. We developed an algorithm to achieve
k-anonymity in the presence of such an adversary. Our algorithm is
based on a distributed particle-filter algorithm in which information
is fused on a binary tree, where information is passed through an
anonymizing proxy to obscure the information's source. The anonymyzing
proxy is a radio that is internal to the network that is elected
through a voting scheme, along with a leader node for the
process. This work was reported in a conference paper (see Outcomes
below), and a journal version is being prepared with a more thorough
security analysis and additional experimental results.</li>

<li> <b>Year 2:</b> In year 2, our efforts have focused on maturing
our approaches to distributed, privacy-preserving localization of a RF
source along two major thrusts. We are further developing our efforts
on RF localization to allow for mobile sensing agents that can
optimize their locations to rapidly localize an RF source in the
presence of channel noise, shadowing, and unknown channel path-loss
exponents. Deep reinforcement learning is being used to determine the
optimal movement for these agents both when privacy is not a concern
and when the movements of the agents must be chosen to protect the
location of the RF source from an adversary that can observe the
movements of the mobile sensing agents.  We are building more
efficient techniques for preserving privacy during distributed
computation by leveraging trusted execution environments, also known
as secure enclaves, that are built into many modern processors. In
particular, our current efforts focus on considering how the Intel
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) can be leveraged in such systems. We
are developing systems that enable a mix of SGX and secure multiparty
computation (SMC) techniques, which are needed for those systems that
are not equipped with SGX-enabled hardware. </li>

<li> <b>Year 3:</b> Our year 3 activities have four main thrusts: 
    1) further development of techniques to leverage secure enclaves to
    provide privacy-preserving computation without the need for heavyweight
    cryptographic primitives (such as fully homomorphic encryption), 2) implementation
    of spectrum sensing techniques using software-defined radios, 3) research on
    applications of machine learning for dynamic spectrum sharing, and 4) research
    on mobile spectrum sensing in the presence of an adversary. A highlight of
    this work is our implementation of spectrum sensing and mapping techniques
    on the USRP X310 software-defined radio. We utilize a FPGA-based spectrum
    sensor to rapidly monitor spectrum utilization across many channels. This
    information is fused with spectrum reports and geolocation information by
    our spectrum mapping software, which is implemented in C++. The result is a
    time-varying spectrum map that identifies how the radio spectrum is being
    used across space, frequency, and time. More details can be found in our publications 
    below.  A notable outcome from our research was that Team GatorWings,
which includes several faculty and students who also worked on this grant, used 
spectrum sensing and mapping techniques developed under this grant in their radio 
used in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2). Team GatorWings won the
SC2 Championship Event in October 2019.</li>

<li> <b> Year 4: (extension)</b> Our year 4 activities had 3 main thrusts: 1) 
We  further developed our implementations of spectrum mapping techniques on
software-defined radios.  2) We have continued to research privacy in spectral
sensing systems, and our current research is primarily focused on privacy
implications related to movements of either the RF emitter or mobile sensors
that are optimizing their position to localize the RF emitter. 3) We have 
continued our research on leveraging secure enclaves to aid in privacy-perserving
signal localization.  </li>

<li> <b> Year 5: (extension)</b> Our year 5 activities had 2 main thrusts: 1) 
    We completed full implementation and evaluation of centralized and
    decentralized implementations of privacy-preserving signal localization
    methods on secure enclaves using Intel SGX and ARM processors. 2) We developed laboratory materials 
    on frequency spectrum, digital radio, and dynamic and collaborative spectrum sharing;
    the lab is targeted to middle-school age children.</li>

<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>Our research has resulted in techniques for privacy-preserving localization techniques in distributed networks, analysis techniques for time-varying networks, and techniques to protect networks from jamming attacks. Our work has been reported in three published conference papers (journal articles are in progress):</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10046080">&quot;Privacy Preserving Localization Using a Distributed Particle Filtering Protocol&quot;</a> (IEEE MILCOM 2017), we developed a privacy preserving localization algorithm based on public-key encryption, anonymous proxies, and a distributed particle filtering protocol. Our protocol is described in detail in that work, and simulation and experimental results (using Ettus Research B210 USRP radios) demonstrate that our proposed mechanism allows for accurate localization with low error.

</p>

</li>
<li><p>In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10046905">&quot;An Adjacency Matrix Approach to Delay Analysis in Temporal Networks&quot;</a> (IEEE MILCOM 2017), we develop analytical techniques to model the flow of information across a temporal network, which is a graph with time-varying edges. Temporal networks can be used to model mobile wireless networks with time-varying links, and these techniques may be used to analyze the flow of private information in such networks.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10046904">&quot;Positioning Helper Nodes to Improve Robustness of Wireless Mesh Networks to Jamming Attacks&quot;</a> (IEEE GlobeCom 2017), we develop techniques to enhance the robustness of wireless networks to jamming attacks, which can be used to disrupt spectrum-sensing processes.</p></li>
<li><p> In <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8886012">&quot;Optimal Jammer Placement in the Real Plane to
    Partition a Wireless Network&quot;</a> (IEEE WCNC 2019), we develop new algorithms to find
minimum cardinality jammer placements to partition a wireless
network. Prior to this paper, optimal solutions were only available
when the placement of jammers was constrained to the locations of the
communication nodes. The algorithms in this paper solve a type of disk
cover problem in which the objective is not to cover all of the
communication nodes but instead only to cover a subset required to
achieve a network partition goal. This same approach may be useful for
other purposes in communication networks, such as the placement of
aerial routers to enhance the robustness of the network topology.  A
variation on this algorithm may be useful for network clustering. For
instance, in the context of distributed RF localization, such a
clustering can be used to enable sets of nearby sensing agents to
either fuse their measurements, elect a single representative to carry
out measurements, or alternate among the agents to provide
measurements and carry out distribute computations.
    <li><p> In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10118962">&#8220;A Hybrid Approach to Secure Function Evaluation using SGX&#8221;</a> (ACM Asia CCS 2019), we develop techniques for two-party secure function evaluation (2P-SFE) that allows a designer to partition parts of the protocol that are evaluated inside a secure enclave and those parts that are implemented via standard cryptographic techniques. This approach allows increased performance while providing protections against side-channel attacks on the secure enclave. We can leverage this approach to reduce the cryptographic overhead of privacy-preserving localization and mapping. </p></li>
    <li><p> In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10133367"> &quot;Reinforcement Learning for Mixed Cooperative/Competitive Dynamic Spectrum Access&quot;</a> (DySPAN 2019), we report on two appoaches to dynamic spectrum sharing using spectrum sensing and mapping techniques developed under this grant. We compare the performance of a strategy learned via reinforcement learning versus a human-tuned &quot;expert system&quot; strategy. The results show similar performance for the two strategies for the scenario investigated, with the expert system performing slightly better overall. This paper provides some high-level overview of our use of spectrum sensing and mapping, as well as our decision making processes, used in the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge. </p></li>
    <li><p> In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10202117">&#8220;Identifying bottleneck nodes using packet delay statistics&#8221;</a> (MILCOM 2019), we investigate methods for identifying single bottlenecks in communication networks when only round-trip delay statistics are available. </p></li>
    <li><p> One of the goals of this project is to investigate how we can leverage cloud computing in privacy-preserving spectrum sensing. Our move to leverage secure enclaves has complicated this because most cloud operators do not provide secure enclaves as part of their service because of various technical challenges that it presents. In <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10118961">&#8220;A Practical Intel SGX Setting for Linux Containers in the Cloud&#8221;</a> (ACM CODASPY 2019), we develop an lxc-based container system that allows Intel SGX (secure enclave) applications to run inside a container in the cloud, while providing all the critical features of SGX, such as remote attestation. We demonstrate that up to 100 containerized SGX applications can be run with reasonable overhead in our system.</p></li>

    <li><p> In <a href="icc21.pdf">&#8220;A Deep Q-Learning Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Experiment&#8221;</a> (IEEE ICC 2021), we report results on applying deep Q-learning for optimizing spectrum sharing among a group of homegeneous networks, where each network makes decisions on how much spectrum to use and which frequencies to transmit on. In particular, we demonstrate that deep Q-learning is able to identify and take advantage of spatial reuse opportunities. All results for the paper are based on experiments carried out in Colosseum and leverage our spectrum mapping and occupancy measurements in making channel assignment decisions.</p>

<p>A conceptual image of our deep Q-network's structure is shown below. We also include visualizations of each team's frequency use over time for two different strategies. The fair-use strategy assigns each of the 5 teams and equal share of the spectrum resources. The deep Q-learning  stratey uses   a convolutional neural network with three hidden layers (and 4 convolution kernels) to optimize spectrum usage via machine learning. In both cases, the strategies choose the number of channels to use, and identical processes using spectrum mapping and occupancy information are used to determine the particular channels each network uses. The deep Q-network was able to score approximately 48% higher than the fair share assignment over multiple runs in the Alleys of Austin scenario in Colosseum.</p>
