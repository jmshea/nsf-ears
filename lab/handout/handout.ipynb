If a team was able to recover their message in the previous round, they should generally reuse the same frequency index as in the previous round. Teams that experienced interference and were not able to recover the transmitted message may decide to switch or not switch because if two teams that were using the same frequency both switch, then they both may switch to the same frequency and cause interference again.\n",
    "1. At a signal from the lab leader, the participating teams will run their transmitters and receivers.\n",

This can determine by listening to the tones being sent or by looking at the plot of power distribution by frequency. Once a team transmits on a frequency, it should continue to use that same frequency provided that they were able to recover the transmitted signal. The team member at the transmitter should tell the team members at the receiver which frequency it is transmitting on. \n",

If it was more than 4, try this experiment again and use the plots of power distribution across frequency to try to determine which frequencies are being used in previous rounds.
